# Local efficiency

Keep parallel reasoning and routine authorized delivery moving without human
prompt churn. Reduce duplicated validation, conflicting local compute,
unnecessary checkouts, stale state, and verified disposable disk use while
preserving sandbox, provider, repository, and release gates.

## Choose the mode

- **Install or update this Mac:** run `bun run scripts/bootstrap.ts --apply`
  from this skill directory, then run it again with `--check`. This manages
  Codex automatic approval review and workspace permissions plus Claude Code
  Auto mode and global guidance; it never enables a bypass-permissions mode.
- **Inspect this Mac:** run `local-efficiency --json` (or
  `bun run scripts/doctor.ts --json`) to check the managed global Codex and
  Claude settings, then run `bun run scripts/workspace-audit.ts` and
  `bun run scripts/session-audit.ts`. All three are read-only. Add
  `--sizes` only when the slower recursive worktree-size estimate is useful.
  The workspace audit reports each Hraness repository's managed guidance
  status; use `repo-adoption.ts --apply --root ABSOLUTE-REPO` for each reported
  `needs-update` repository.
- **Measure local throughput:** run `throughput-report` for the bounded,
  privacy-safe scheduler history. Treat repeat command digests and silent tasks
  as review heuristics, never as proof of waste or abandonment.
- **Run heavyweight local work:** resolve `host-run` to its installed
  absolute path and use `ABSOLUTE-HOST-RUN
  --mode=shared|heavy|exclusive
  --lane=compute|browser|browser-auth|mac-native --label=LABEL
  [--max-hold=DURATION|none] [--full-cpu] -- COMMAND ...` through
  reviewed host access. Keep the complete wrapper and child argv visible to
  Codex.
- **Record or reuse deterministic focused validation:** use `validation-run`.
  Reuse is opt-in and is never valid for a required final integration,
  merge-queue, deployment, release, authenticated-browser, or network-sensitive
  gate.
- **Reclaim Git worktrees:** audit first with `workspace-audit.ts`, then invoke
  `worktree-cleanup.ts` separately in each owning repository with every approved
  absolute path named through `--remove`.
- **Adopt or check repository guidance:** use `repo-adoption.ts --check` or
  `--apply`. It edits only the exact managed policy block in root `AGENTS.md`
  and adds an `@AGENTS.md` import to root `CLAUDE.md` while preserving existing
  Claude-specific guidance.
- **Audit CI ref isolation:** use `ci-ref-audit --root ABSOLUTE-REPO`. Review
  every candidate; fix only workflows whose complete-history gate can import
  unrelated refs, and preserve the complete-history scan itself.

Run scripts from the installed skill directory when the convenience commands
are unavailable. `bootstrap.ts` installs or refreshes those commands under the
user's Bun bin directory. It verifies a minimal pinned Atet host-resource
runtime in the user's local data directory; it never replaces a global Atet
package or command.

## Preserve the invariants

- Treat a user request that places a repository and outcome in scope as
  standing authorization for routine task-owned commits, pushes, pull requests,
  merges, releases, and deployments after required gates pass. Do not ask for a
  second conversational confirmation. Runtime denials, missing credentials, and
  material product decisions still stop the work.
- Prefer short-lived repository workload identities, npm trusted publishing,
  and scoped GitHub App tokens over personal sessions and reusable secrets.
  Batch unavoidable interactive authentication at the final boundary rather
  than spreading it across retries or releases.

- Do not cap agent count merely to reduce fan-out. Parallel reasoning and
  independent implementation lanes remain desirable.
- Prefer bounded subagents in the current task for research, review, diagnosis,
  and focused checks when they can safely share one working tree. A separate
  task or worktree is warranted for independently deliverable divergent edits,
  an intentionally isolated verification tree, or a different environment.
- Give each focused check one worker owner. The integrator reviews the diff and
  reported evidence, repeating a focused command only when the tree changed,
  evidence is missing, or a repair invalidated it.
- Give each CI run, merge-queue item, provider operation, or deployment wait one
  waiter. Do not hold a compute lease while waiting on external state.
- Run the repository's aggregate/final gate once after convergence. Never use a
  receipt to skip a repository-required final replayed-tree or delivery gate.
- The host scheduler is an outer layer. Jungle and other repositories keep their own
  schedulers underneath it; invoke `host-run` only around top-level
  commands. Nested `host-run` calls inherit the outer lease and do not
  acquire again.
- Keep roots and integrators on the caller's selected model. Bounded independent
  workers may use the installed `worker` or `routine` profiles when the
  task merits them; measure repair rate rather than assuming cheaper is better.
- This baseline is local-only. Do not create, configure, or route work to Codex
  cloud through this skill.

## Capability lanes

- **Ordinary:** research, review, edits, and narrow checks. Share the current
  task worktree when safe and normally do not acquire a host lease.
- **Heavy compute:** broad builds and repository gates. Use the `compute` lane
  with `heavy` or `exclusive` mode.
- **Browser (headless):** agent-browser, Playwright, or Chromium checks with a
  fresh temporary profile. Use the `browser` lane (4 slots). Default max hold
  20 min.
- **Browser auth:** only work that drives the user's signed-in browser profile
  or a headed interactive login. Use the `browser-auth` lane (1 slot) and keep
  one owner. Default max hold 45 min.
- **Never in a browser lane:** static file servers, `next dev`/preview servers,
  and merge-queue, CI, or deploy drain loops. Start a server on
  `${PORT:-$(hra-port NAME)}` bound to 127.0.0.1 with a trap that stops it when
  the command ends, and wrap only each local validation step of a drain loop,
  never the wait. `dev-server-reap` reports servers left behind.
- **Chrome:** never launch the installed, auto-updating Google Chrome from a
  shell or test. Use Chrome for Testing or the project's pinned Playwright
  Chromium with a temporary profile. Agent-browser inside host-run launches
  through `hra-chrome`, which retains explicit executable selection and reads
  `executablePath` from `./agent-browser.json` over `~/.agent-browser/config.json`
  when no executable override exists. For direct launches, use
  `$HRA_CHROME`/`hra-chrome` with `HRA_CHROME_REAL` set to the provisioned binary;
  `AGENT_BROWSER_CONFIG` can select a specific config file. Missing or unsafe
  executables fail with provisioning guidance; there is no system-Chrome
  fallback or guessed cache version. The launcher merges
  `PaintHolding,MacAppCodeSignClone` into one `--disable-features` switch and
  always adds `--mute-audio` to prevent bundle clones and stray audio. Close
  owned browsers and pass a timeout to one-shot `--screenshot` runs. Attaching
  to the user's signed-in Chrome remains a separate authorized browser-auth
  flow that preserves its profile and lifetime. When the signed-in Chrome is
  itself the blocker — a stale in-place-updated process whose executable no
  longer resolves to the kernel, wedged audio, or a hung window —
  `hra-chrome-restart` SIGTERMs the main process so the session saves, waits
  for a clean exit, relaunches through `open -a` under LaunchServices (never
  an agent-owned child), and verifies the new process's executable record
  resolves. It refuses when Chrome is not running and never force-kills; a
  Chrome that ignores TERM is reported, not SIGKILLed. Run it inside the
  `browser-auth` lane.
- **Mac native:** Xcode, Simulator, Keychain, signed-app, or other macOS-only
  work. Keep it on a Mac, assign one owner, and use the `mac-native` lane.

The browser, browser-auth and Mac lanes bound their scarce capability while
still sharing the weighted compute capacity; on those lanes `exclusive` means
exclusive use of the capability and takes at most 2 CPU permits by default.
For macOS-only work that needs all CPU capacity, opt in with
`--mode=exclusive --lane=mac-native --full-cpu`. The bare `--full-cpu` flag is
valid only with that mode and lane; it reserves every CPU permit and the one
Mac-native slot before starting the command. Other modes and lanes reject it.
A nested wrapper must be covered by the outer lane (a `browser-auth` owner may
also run `browser` work) and CPU reservation. A two-permit native owner cannot
escalate to full CPU on a machine with more than two permits; a full-capacity
native owner covers ordinary or full-CPU native work and compute work. Choose
the top-level reservation correctly instead of escalating inside a lease.

Every admitted lease has a wall-clock cap: exclusive 60 min, browser 20 min,
browser-auth 45 min (the smallest applicable wins; compute shared/heavy have
none). host-run warns at 80%, then sends TERM and finally KILL to the leased
command only, and records outcome `hold-timeout` (exit 124). Pass
`--max-hold=90m` (or `none`) with a reason when a run genuinely needs longer.
A queued claim gives up after 2 h (exit 75, `QUEUE_TIMEOUT`); while it waits,
host-run prints each holder's label, pid, and age every minute.

Inside a lease host-run sets `HRA_JOBS`, `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS`,
`NEXTEST_TEST_THREADS`, `RAYON_NUM_THREADS`, and `MAKEFLAGS=-jN` to
permits x cores / capacity when they are unset, and `RUSTC_WRAPPER=sccache`
only when sccache is already installed. Repository test configs should read
`HRA_JOBS` for worker counts.

For non-interactive macOS and Linux runs, the wrapper supervises a dedicated
child process group and forwards `HUP`, `INT`, `QUIT`, and `TERM` to the whole
group. An interactive TTY preserves its controlling terminal and receives
best-effort leader signaling so an intentional 2FA prompt still works. Do not
detach a background server from scheduler custody.

## Resource modes

Use `shared` for one narrow check, `heavy` for production builds and ordinary
repository-wide checks, and `exclusive` for full monorepo validation, native
packaging, capture hardware, or timing-budget suites that need a quiet host
(`--lane=compute --mode=exclusive`). Headless browser suites are
`--lane=browser --mode=shared|heavy`; a fixed port is not a reason for
`exclusive`: take a port from `hra-port` instead.

Submit `exclusive` work only after its inputs converge. Strict FIFO prevents
starvation but can strand spare permits behind a waiting all-permit claim. If
that happens ahead of a known finite shared/heavy backlog, only the exclusive
claim's owner may cancel it before admission and requeue the identical command
after the backlog drains. Never interrupt an admitted command just to reorder
the queue, and never run its child outside the scheduler.

Known mappings:

- Jungle `check:affected`: heavy; Jungle full `check`: exclusive.
- Personal template and Tiff full check/build: heavy.
- Narrow file or package tests: normally unscheduled.

The wrapper runs the original public command unchanged. It does not substitute
a weaker check.

Each top-level scheduler attempt appends one bounded local telemetry record when
storage is available. A pre-admission scheduler error or catchable cancellation
has no admission timestamp or run duration; cancellation is recorded before the
waiting claim is released. Records contain timestamps, lane, mode, safe label, program
label, permit counts, queue and run durations, an exit class, a hashed workspace
identifier, and a command digest. They never contain raw argv, environment
values, paths, transcripts, reasoning, or tool output. Telemetry is best effort
and never changes the child command's result.

## Host-access boundary

The machine-wide scheduler state intentionally lives outside an ordinary
repository sandbox. Request reviewed host access for the top-level absolute
`host-run` invocation on the first attempt. This also applies to focused
process-custody and recovery tests: they exercise machine-scoped identity
and journal locks even when their CPU cost is small.

If the wrapper reports `HOST_ACCESS_REQUIRED` and exits 77, retry the
identical wrapper invocation once through Codex host-access approval or
configured auto-review. Preserve the working directory and every argument. If
the reviewed retry still returns 77, stop and diagnose the permission setup.
Never bypass the wrapper by running its child directly, remove scheduler or
recovery state, weaken fail-closed custody, or create an unconditional allow
rule for `host-run`; it can wrap arbitrary child commands.

The bootstrap sets Codex to `approval_policy = "on-request"`,
`approvals_reviewer = "auto_review"`, and `default_permissions = ":workspace"`.
It also manages a prompt-only Codex rule for the absolute installed wrapper.
The rule makes every complete invocation reviewable but grants no permission.
Codex loads configuration and rule files at task startup, so start a new task
after installing or updating the baseline.

When the installed Claude Code is at least 2.1.83 and
`claude auto-mode config` confirms that the CLI exposes a valid Auto-mode
configuration surface, the bootstrap sets
`permissions.defaultMode = "auto"` and inherits its built-in classifier rules
through `$defaults`. Because explicit allow rules resolve before the Auto
classifier, the bootstrap removes bare or universal whole-tool allows and every wildcarded
Bash or PowerShell allow while preserving exact commands, path-bounded
non-shell allows, and every deny. Claude may apply additional runtime filtering. It
does not globally declare sibling repositories or the public npm registry
trusted. The doctor reports the machine capability
decision. If the CLI does not expose that surface, bootstrap leaves the
ordinary permission setting untouched. Account, model, and organization
eligibility is enforced by Claude Code when a session starts rather than
attested by the configuration command; if that runtime gate refuses Auto mode,
use the ordinary permission mode and never fall back to bypass permissions.

## Validation receipts

`validation-run` fingerprints the Git HEAD, tracked diff, untracked file content
and executable/link mode, working directory, exact command, Bun/Node versions,
lockfiles, and caller contexts. It never follows untracked symlinks. Successful
receipts live under the repository's Git common directory
so linked worktrees can share exact evidence. Receipts and wrapper output retain
only a safe operation label, program name, and command digest—not raw argv or
context values. Reuse fails closed when the index contains skip-worktree or
assume-unchanged entries, a populated gitlink/submodule, or an unsupported
untracked file type.

Use `--reuse --ttl-minutes=N` only for deterministic focused commands. Force a
real run after relevant environment or external state changes. Failed commands
are reported for diagnosis but never reused as success.

## Complete-history CI

A complete-history policy is not permission to fetch every live branch. Start
from the exact governed SHA, disable credential persistence, and explicitly
fetch only the fully qualified branch, tag, or exact-SHA refs the policy owns.
Enumerate refs immediately afterward and reject any unexpected ref before the
history scan. Keep `rev-list --all` or the repository's equivalent complete
scan over that governed ref set.

Use `ci-ref-audit` as a conservative review aid. A broad fetch without a
complete-history consumer is informational, and a complete-history consumer
with an explicit governed ref set is compliant. Do not rewrite release history
fetches mechanically; tags and the stable branch may both be required inputs.

## Cleanup safety

Size is a discovery signal, not deletion authority. A removable worktree must
be registered, present, clean including untracked and ignored files, free of
skip-worktree and assume-unchanged index flags and populated gitlinks, neither
primary nor the invoking worktree, explicitly named, and merged into an exactly
fetched, fully qualified remote target. The cleanup script validates the full
manifest before deletion and revalidates every target at action time. It never
forces removal or deletes branches.

Treat unregistered temporary directories, Codex transcripts, application
databases, credentials, private corpora, archives, and dirty worktrees as user
state. Never sweep a temporary-path prefix.

At task closeout, record the applicable final branch, pull request, checks,
merge, release, deployment, and production readback. Archive only a
conclusively finished task; silence is not completion evidence. In the Codex
app, archiving a completed managed-worktree task lets the app snapshot and
reclaim its managed checkout. Permanent worktrees still require their own
guarded cleanup.

## Machine standard

`bootstrap.ts` manages one marked block in global Codex `AGENTS.md`, three
top-level Codex permission settings, one marked block in global Claude
`CLAUDE.md`, Claude's Auto-mode default, bounded environment, and broad-allow
cleanup, two optional
CLI profiles, a prompt-only host-access rule, a minimal private scheduler
runtime, and convenience commands. It preserves unrelated TOML, JSON, Markdown,
and rule content, leaves exact profile symlinks intact, and refuses unsafe
targets. Use `--check` in automation and after plugin upgrades.

This plugin ships in the `hraness-skillpack` marketplace
(`hraness/skillpack`, plugin `local-efficiency`). After installing or
upgrading it, rerun bootstrap and start a new Codex task so the refreshed
skill is discovered.
